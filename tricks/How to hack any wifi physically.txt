You will need confidence, patient & acting

Story kinda: Let's say your in a restaraunt and you want to get the password of their wifi but they don't allow you since they won't let you look at your phone or them typing the wifi password. So heres what your going to do:

1. Download https://keylogger.en.aptoide.com/app and make sure to allow the app to use accessibility I think yeah bad memory.
2.Double check If It's working and If It's worknig give your phone to someone in the restaurant and tell them you want to use their wifi, so even though they won't let you look at your phone the keylogger will log it.
3.Done! :)
