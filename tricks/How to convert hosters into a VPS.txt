Note: This might work & not, but it depends on the hoster so It's 50-50.

Ways:
+ Host https://github.com/I2rys/EAS in the NodeJS hoster and execute some commands, or make your own NodeJS uhh command executor via API.
+ Reverse shell in the hoster.
+ Just think on how to execute commands in the inside from the outside.
