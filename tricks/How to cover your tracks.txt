Note: Don't use it to do something bad. This is just for fun because I'm bored.

Ways to cover your tracks:
+ Know your target
+ Know your only objectives exclude the others
+ Know the place
+ Recite or simulate where all the cameras hidden/not are placed
+ Make a plan
+ Double check
+ Don't leave any evidences
+ Cover your eyes, nose, hair, fingerprints, face & voice(Don't talk)(Cover all of them because if they can get your fingerprints your done and the others too for double you know).
+ Only strike when It's the right time
+ Fake your license plate
+ Operate in the dark
+ Stay hidden
+ If you have someone to help you that could be risk so It's better to do it all by your self
+ Don't expose your location
+ If you have a lot of money, you know corruption right? Use it as your advantage to hide your tracks too
+ When you want to remove your evidence by throwing it somewhere then there is a 50/50 chance that you will get caught. Keep the evidence like knife or uhh kahoot?? Just clean it or burn it.
