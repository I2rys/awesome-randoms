First off, this is just for fun and summarized yeah.

Alright let's get started, there is 2 ways to leak big companies secret documents. First is inside and second is outside

What do you mean inside?
By applying a job on the company and because you are working inside the company you'll going to learn a lot about the company and It's a big advantage too.

After your inside the company do some reconnaissance, research online & etc and that will lead you to finding sensitive stuff.

What do you mean outside?
If the company has a website or something online and you have a knowledge in hacking then maybe you can hack there website or something to get sensitive documents.
