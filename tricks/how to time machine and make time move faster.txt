They say time machine is impossible but no, It is possible but you can't go in the feature & past because It's impossible even if you use wormholes it won't work unless you have a magic and you can only make the time move faster. Anyways here are the ways to do that:
1.Sleeping.
2.Keep your self busy.
3.Ignore the time unless necessary, because looking at the time will make it slower.
4.Do things you genuinely enjoy.
5.Practice a mental challenge.
6.Watch videos or listen to music.
7.Do your school stuff.
