This method centers around the Skyblock Gamemode in the Minecraft server Hypixel.net

In short, the game is around grinding hours of your life away for small stat boosts and coins to buy things to make that grind easier, and as you may have guessed many many MANy people don't want to grind away hours of their life but still want their fancy expensive weapons and stats to show off. This is what makes this method un-saturable as long as the game stays alive.

WHAT YOU NEED:
Minecraft Accounts with Username capture
A decent not very widely used VPN, VyprVPN works perfectly for this
Charisma
Minimal morals, particularly not enough to feel bad about robbing a child of some hours of their life
First, you take all your Minecraft Accounts and put their Usernames into https://sky.lea.moe/ and check whether they have any money in their bank

Check if they have any balance or any active profiles at all , this account has 19m which is an easy 9-10$

You can sell coins for .35-1$ per million, it depends where you sell them like if you sell it in the community of people that already do under the table stuff they won't pay much cause they do this themselves but if you hit the legit player population they'll be happy to pay 1$ per million.

If you get like 20 decent NFA Hypixel Minecraft accounts I guarantee that you will easily get at least 30$ in coins

Log into your account on a VPN and cross your fingers that it doesn't get security locked/ ip banned because then the account is gonna be bricked for another 30d

transfer all the coins to an SFA or throwaway account of that sort, there is IRL trading protection and your account will be banned for a year and wiped if youre caught so I dont recommend doing it on a main you would like to play hypixel on yk

I would also recommend putting the coins on multiple accounts incase one of them gets banned before you get to selling it, its never happened to me but its better safe than sorry

Once you have all your accounts, go find hypixel skyblock discord servers on some random discord account, most don't have phone or email verification required so just make it look legit yk

Just advertise that you're quitting skyblock and you're selling whatever amount of coins you have for irl and you might get banned from said servers but just wait for the dms to flow in ;)

rinse and repeat for fat money and like if you start getting a name for yourself as a legit seller people are gonna get referred to you and you can upsell a tiny bit, just don't go over $1 per that's gay and people are gonna leave on you lmao
and idk this might be my morals kicking in but

also sorry for shit spacing, it looked weird as hell without it but still weird with it ;d

I dont recommend griefing their shit and account if you end up selling their coins, it does take a lot of work and the coins arent that big of a loss for most kids so it really hurts no one in the long term
