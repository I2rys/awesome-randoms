1. https://anonfile.com/f31dd1Aenf/Madleets...tifier_rar
2. https://anonfile.com/ge13d3A5n4/ORHTv3.3_rar

First of all:
Download tools

After you are done with that, you want to open tool, called: "Madleets Hash Identifier", go to your combolist and copy one of those hashes and past it in blank space in Madleets Hash Identifier, than just "Identifi Hash", and you will get results.

Now go to ORHTv.3.3 tool, run it (Online reverse tool), click ok.
First make sure all services are checked.
After that, choose HASH TYPE ( You click on Hash Type MD 5 (it's default MD 5 in this tool) ) and then you choose.
Go to control, options, proxy, find some proxies and past it (it's optional, but I suggest you to use it), then click OK
After that click on main menu and click on Start from file, click OK and then - find your combolist and open it.
