Note: This is just for fun. Don't do something bad ^^

You see prodigies are awesome, there are kids that has an extraordinarily ability, is good in specific field and is under the age of 10. So how do we exploit them?
We need to be:
A good person
Trustable
Loyal
Friendly
Helpful
Sharing is caring :)
Stealhy
And Patient
Lying

1.We can exploit them by gaining there trust first because some prodigies are smart, means they won't just trust you immediately without a reason.
2.After gaining there trust that doesn't mean we can just execute our exploit on them immediately, instead we are going to use(exploit) them slowly so they won't raise suspicioun or feel like something is wrong.
3.Execute your exploit on them slowly, and when they ask something that can be related to your exploit like they raise suspicioun just go with the flow but slowly lead it to the other direction.
4.Repeat.
